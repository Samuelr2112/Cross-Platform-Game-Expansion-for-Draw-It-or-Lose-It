# Draw It or Lose It - Cross-Platform Design
# Project Overview
This project focuses on the redesign of the game Draw It or Lose It, originally an Android application, to be compatible with multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS. The goal is to convert the game into a web-based application with a modern, responsive user interface. This will enable the game to be played seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices, allowing for broader accessibility and user reach. The new design also ensures scalability and flexibility by leveraging web technologies, ensuring a smooth user experience on all platforms.

# Features
The project emphasizes cross-platform compatibility, using a serverless architecture like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Platform to automatically scale the system based on user demand. Security is also a major focus, with the application incorporating best practices such as OAuth 2.0 authentication, encryption, and granular access control to protect sensitive user data. The system is designed to handle thousands of concurrent users, ensuring high performance while adhering to strict security guidelines.

# Files
The project includes detailed design documentation, outlining the architecture of the game and the technical requirements for its transition to a web-based platform. Recommendations are also provided for optimizing serverless architecture, data storage using services like AWS DynamoDB, and implementing robust security measures.
